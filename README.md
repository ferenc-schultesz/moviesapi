# MoviesAPI - Technical test
Technology used:
- .Net Core 2
- Entity Framework Core
- Xunit for unit testing

## What I would add / polish
- Unit testing for each controller method
- More sophisticated filtering method for Movies resources
- Customize Swagger
- Add comments to the code
- Add the project to CircleCI and deploy it on Heroku
